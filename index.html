    Roblox is an online game platform and game-creation system created by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and play games created by other users. It is the primary product of Roblox Corporation. Founded by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games, designated as "experiences" since May 2021, of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and a company, due to both co-founder Baszucki's lack of interest in press coverage and it being "lost among the crowd" in a large number of platforms released around the same time. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth was accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of the 2020s.
